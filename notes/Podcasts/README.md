### [EN] [Cortex](http://pca.st/cortex) (5/5 stars)
A podcast with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley about their working lives, productivity, apple products and interesting ideas. Really good to get new ideas.

### [DE] [@Autoweird.fm](http://pca.st/TFXI) (4/5 stars)
A german podcast about software development. Very casual and there is definitely beer involved.
Pretty good.
