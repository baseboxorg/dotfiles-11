# Books I can recommend 

### :us: [Scrum: The art of doing twice the work in half the time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288230-scrum)

>We live in a world that is broken. For those who believe that there must be a more efficient way for people to get things done, here from Scrum pioneer Jeff Sutherland is a brilliantly discursive, thought-provoking book about the management process that is changing the way we live.

A really good book with many stories, about the origin of Scrum, how it came to be and how it was used.

### :us: [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22543496-elon-musk)

>The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting only the right things done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  
>
> By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.

I really found this book helpful. The concept of "less, but better" was eye opening. Everybody should read this book.
