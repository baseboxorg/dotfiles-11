### :us: Scrum: The art of doing twice the work in half the time

>We live in a world that is broken. For those who believe that there must be a more efficient way for people to get things done, here from Scrum pioneer Jeff Sutherland is a brilliantly discursive, thought-provoking book about the management process that is changing the way we live.

A really good book with many stories, about the origin of Scrum, how it came to be and how it was used.
